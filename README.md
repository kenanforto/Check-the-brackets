# Check-the-brackets
Each opened bracket must be followed by a corresponding closed bracket of the same type, so for example 
"[a}" is not legal because it is an opened middle bracket and a closed small bracket. Only a smaller
bracket type can be inside a larger bracket type (for example {[()]} is correct and this {([])} is not
, {}>[]>() ).
